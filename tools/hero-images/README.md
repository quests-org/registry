# Quests Starter Template

The Quests default starter template is a simple, yet powerful micro-framework for building full-stack apps.

**React** serves as the frontend component framework, leveraging the large React ecosystem of components and frontend functionality. The application is built and served by **Vite**, a modern and efficient bundler and dev server. **Tailwind CSS V4** is used for styling the app and works well with the Quests AI Agent.

The Quest starter template is fully capable of building full stack applications with backend APIs. It ships out of the box with support for **Hono** and **oRPC** to build type-safe APIs.
